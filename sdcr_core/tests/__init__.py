"""
SDCR CORE — Tests
================

Test suite for validating the SDCR CORE framework.

Tests in this package focus on:
- numerical sanity checks
- null behavior (ε = 0)
- stability of reduced dynamics
- reproducibility of example outputs

The test suite is intentionally lightweight and framework-oriented,
designed to catch regressions without constraining future extensions.
